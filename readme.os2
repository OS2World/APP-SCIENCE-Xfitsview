Xfitsview for Xfree86-OS/2 will only run on 8 bpp displays. This is a limitation of the original code .
You will not be able to change drives unless you use the Toronto Virtual File System (TVFS)
which replicates unix style handling of multiple drives on OS/2.
this archive contains both the executable and the source code for Xfitsview
